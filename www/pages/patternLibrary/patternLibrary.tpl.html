        <p>Gray whales are unique to the species because they are one of the only whales that consistently eat from the
            bottom of the ocean. <strong>In order to obtain food these whales will swim to the bottom of the ocean and
                role
                on their side (strong, b)</strong>; causing the water to lift up various sea sediments and prey. These
            whales will eat
            everything that comes up from crabs and larvae to plankton and small fish. Gray whales are very large and
            can
            consume in excess of 3,000 pounds of food on a daily basis <a

                    <p>Using cryptic numeric codes to represent node types is not a very JavaScript-like thing to do.
                        Later
                        in this chapter, we’ll see that other parts of the DOM interface also feel cumbersome and alien.
                        The
                        reason for this is that the DOM wasn’t designed for just JavaScript. Rather, it tries to define
                        a
                        language-neutral interface that can be used in other systems as well—not just HTML but also XML,
                        which is a generic data format with an HTML-like syntax.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is unfortunate. Standards are often useful. But in this case, the advantage (cross-language
                        consistency) isn’t all that compelling. Having an interface that is properly integrated with the
                        language you are using will save you more time than having a familiar interface across
                        languages.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As an example of such poor integration, consider the <span class="code">childNodes</span>
                        property
                        that element nodes in the
                        DOM have. This property holds an array-like object, with a length property and properties
                        labeled by
                        numbers to access the child nodes. But it is an instance of the <span
                            class="code">NodeList</span>
                        type, not a real array, so
                        it does not have methods such as <span class="code">slice</span> and <span
                            class="code">forEach</span>.</p>
